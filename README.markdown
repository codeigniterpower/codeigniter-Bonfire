Solid base development off of which to build your new web applications.
It's not a CMS. Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build.

All wrapped up in an elegant interface that will make you proud when you hand the project over to your client.

- Very flexible template/theme system, capable of **Wordpress-like parent/child themes.**
- With Twitter **Bootstrap styled** for the Admin and Default themes
- Fully **modular HMVC compilant**, with Database backup and maintenance interface
- **Role-based access control**, with **Built-in users/auth** solid system
- Code Builder with CRUD generation
- Simple email queue system
- 2-step installer
- Uses multiple-environment config files.
- Migration-ready (using either raw SQL or Database Forge commands)
- Log view/maintenance

## INSTALL

The more detailed are in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file, please read that instead!

#### Requirements

* php 5,4+

#### Manual controlled install

Clone or donwload the code

`wget `

Put your files uncompresed at the web root or directory sub root where your webserver can take and expose

Create the database with `applications/db/database.sql` and setup that database credentials

Open your browser and go to `http://yourserverip/public` and follow the installer

Theres ready to use 4 ‘contexts’ for coding: Content, Reports, Settings and Developer Tools

### Branches

This its a fork that contains this brand named "develop-fornovices" this comes with CI3 and some lasted 
from official repository.

Due to the shift from CI2 to CI3, there are 2 branches containing recent releases and 3 development branches.

- The releases are in the 0.8.x (v0.8.x) and 0.7.x (v0.7.x) branches. There are quite outdated, works for older systems
- The development branches are develop (v0.9+), 0.8-dev (v0.8.x), and 0.7-dev (v0.7.x). Have some updates something.

Bug fixes are currently being made to all three development branches, but 0.7-dev and 0.8-dev are now bugfix-only branches.

- v0.7.x uses CodeIgniter 2 by default. CI3 is supported, but not included. Its very old.
- v0.8.x uses CodeIgniter 3 by default. CI2 is supported, but not included. Its quite old.
- v0.9+ uses CodeIgniter 3, and will not continue to support CI2. Its modern with some ooutdated tips.
- develop-fornovices uses CodeIgniter 3 and some modifications with ideas that comes from codeigniter power.

The develop branch will be the only branch receiving new features and/or major code changes. But only in the official project.
This repository its a fork.
